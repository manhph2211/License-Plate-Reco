# License-Template-Recognition :smiley:


This is my final project in technical thinking sub> Thanks to [this amazing tutorial](https://medium.com/@quangnhatnguyenle/detect-and-recognize-vehicles-license-plate-with-machine-learning-and-python-part-1-detection-795fda47e922) for helping me a lot in doing this project :smile:

## 1. Requirements

- Python==3.6
- OpenCV==4.1.0
- Numpy==1.17.4
- sklearn==0.21.3
- Keras==2.3.1
- Tensorflow==1.14.0
- Gradio == 1.4.0

## 2. Usage 

- Just run `python3 deploy.py`  to try the application in your local host(I just used gradio for deployment). However, this might require quite a long time...

- Or you can run `python3 test.py` to get license plates right from the terminal.


## 3. Result

## 4. Todo :sleepy:

- Improve/optimize the detecting time as well as the acc
- Find the best `Dmax`, `Dmin`
